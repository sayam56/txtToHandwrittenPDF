<h1 align="center"> Text to Handwriting Conversion Utility Through <b>PYTHON</b> Script </h1>
<h4 align="center"> A streamlined Approach to <a href="https://github.com/sharanya02/Text-file-to-handwritten-pdf-file"> Sharanya's</a> project<h4>
  
  <p>
  This project was developed to streamline the process of <a href="https://github.com/sharanya02/Text-file-to-handwritten-pdf-file"> Sharanya's</a> python script that converts a .txt file to a handwritten PDF. However, I have taken the liberty to upload my own handwriting and built a VERY simple utility that would convert any .txt file to my handwritten PDF.
 
  </p>
  
#Workings:
  - This Utility executes the python script on the server itself.
  - The server has all the dependencies pre-installed in the proper directory according to  <a href="https://github.com/sharanya02/Text-file-to-handwritten-pdf-file/blob/master/README.md"> THESE</a> instructions.
  - Users upload a .txt file into the server
  - The system checks for the correct file format.
  - The file is then fed into the script and the output is then generated and prepped for download.
  
  
#Future Scope:
- Custom handwriting upload IS possible.
- A database to upload multiple files and download multiple files at the same time could very well be implemented.


#PreCaution:
I am NOT uploading this to a proper server with all the added functionalities because there is a huge chance of misusing this amazing project.
Please use it at your own discretion.
